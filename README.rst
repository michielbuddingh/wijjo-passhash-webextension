Passhash Clipboard
------------------

You probably don't need this add-on.  This extension is intended for
people who used the 'passhash' extension authored by `Steve Cooper`_.
This is a very minimal webextension adaptation, that uses the exact
same JavaScript code - and generates the exact same passwords.

Unlike other add-ons, this one does not attempt to find password
fields on the active web page, or add buttons to them.  When you want
to generate a password, just click the toolbar button, type your
password, Copy to clipboard, paste and press 'Wipe' to clear your
clipboard of sensitive data.

Please *only* use this extension to migrate old passwords to newer,
safer methods.
